- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreiRoibu-synthara
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science, Customer Interactions and generally a happy, calm and simple life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything that has to do with memory chip design. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that needs to be done :-)
- 📫 How to reach me: andrei.roibu@synthara.ai
- 😄 Pronouns: Don't really care about these things...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I trained to join the Romanian secret service, worked for 2 years in politics, studied and worked in aerospace engineering working on aircraft concepts, market dynamics and sattelite propulsion, thought myself programming, and built a whole lot of projects from AI for medical imaging to deep reinformcement learning.
